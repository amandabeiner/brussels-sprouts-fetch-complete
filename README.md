# Brussels Sprouts Fetch!

A refactored version of "Ajax Brussels Sprouts", part of Launch Academy's HTTP/Sinatra and Asynchronous JavaScript curriculum. This app has a function to get a random recipe that should be called on the `onClick` listener of a button, and a function to get all of the recipes that can be called on a different button click.

You should write the fetch call to the API endpoints defined in the `server.rb` file to make these two functions work.

As a potential refactor, call one of these functions on `componentDidMount` to make the page not be blank on load!

## Setup
To get set up, run the following:

```no-highlight
  bundle
  ruby server.rb
```

In a separate terminal tab, run:

```no-highlight
  npm install
  npm start
```

Then navigate to `localhost:4567`
